Ok, let's try once again another blog about coding and stuff around IT.
I work as a tech-lead/architect mainly dealing with java plus spring, sometimes groovy, sometimes bash, python, typescript... you know.
As usual I'd like to share the knowledge that was collected during 7 years of my professional career.
Hope it would be useful and might help someone.

Anyway, I don't think that someone ever read this page, so this post is just for statistics.
