Ok, let's try once again another blog about coding and stuff around IT.
I'll write sometimes in English, sometimes in Russian cause I like both.
I work as a tech-lead/architect for [PayCash][paycash] already more than a 3 years.
We mainly write in Java, but sometimes groovy, sometimes bash, python, typescript... you know.
As usual I'd like to share the knowledge painfully collected over 7 years in IT.
Hope it would be usefull and might help someone.

Anyway, I don't think someone ever read this page, so this is just for good manners - first post.
